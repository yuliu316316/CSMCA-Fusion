The demo file is Script.m.  

Our implementation is based on the SPORCO library developed by Dr. Brendt Wohlberg, available at http://math.lanl.gov/~brendt/Software/SPORCO/. We also refer to Dr. He Zhang's code related to the paper "Convolutional sparse coding-based image decomposition" (BMVC 2016). We would like to thank Dr. Wohlberg and Dr. Zhang for their great contributions.
